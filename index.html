                <h3>MOUNTAIN VIEW</h3>
                <p>A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally 
                    with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, 
                    a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually 
                    higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding 
                    land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.</p>
